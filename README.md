 QGIS plugin development

I am developing at least one and possible more plugins for QGIS as part of my work for RAÄ.
The first plugin will search through a vector field, either for unique values or a supplied search phrase and create centroids for the collections of all objects matching.
For example, RAÄ data has an attribute field för "lämningstyp" (type of ruin/remains) in which each object has an attribute taken from a predefined list. 
The plugin searches for each object of each type and creates a centroid for each type, with count and percentage of total as attributes.
