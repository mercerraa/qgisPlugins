about=RAÃ„s buildings (byggnader) are points that may or may not have an explicit connection to a property unit (LMs ay objects). The plugin firsts looks for the explicit connection (FNR_FDS). If this fails it tries to match the byggnad point to an LM by building polygon, which can then be matched to a property. If the byggnad point lies outside of a building then, as a last resort it is snapped to one.
