<h1>Quick Introduction</h1>
<p>There are two main use cases. In the first, select a vector layer and then a field from that vector. 
This field should contain attributes from a list, i.e. a limited number of distinct values, such as type of object. 
The plugin will then create a centroid for each distinct value. 
In the second, instead of a field with list derived attributes a query (expression) is given to find those object matching the query and a centroid is created for that attribute match. 
In each case the number of matching objects and their percentage of the total are stored as attributes for the centroid object.
</p>
<h1>More detail</h1>
Start by selecting the layer to work with, using the upper "comboBox". 
Then select the field in that layer you wish to search through usin the lower comboBox.
<h2>Case one</h2>
<p>In the first case given above each attribute is derived from a list of possible values, such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>House</li>
    <li>Garage</li>
    <li>Shed</li>
    <li>Gnome</li>
    <li>Flamingo</li>
</ul>

Each object in the vector layer can have one attribute from the list and many objects can have the same attribute value, i.e. there may be many gnomes (too many?)
The plugin will find all the unique values in the selected field and then create a list of these values.
It will then loop through this list.
For each element in this list it will then search for each object in the vector layer with a matching attribute value and then from this selection create a centroid.
Each centroid will receive two attributes: the count, i.e. number of matches and the percentage of the total number of objects within the parent vector that this count represents.

<h2>Case two</h2>
<p>This will return one centroid only.
Start as in case one; select the layer and then the field you wish to search through.
Press the E button at the right and build the query/expression you wish to use.</p>
<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>There are several detailed resourses on line describing how to build an expression such as <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.34/en/docs/user_manual/expressions/expression.html">QGIS own documentation.</a>
</p>
<p>The Expression Builder window has three panels.
The left panel contains a text entry panel that displays the current query/expression.
Below this are some simple, commonly used operators and below these you can see some feedback from QGIS.
Check here to see that QGIS thinks your expresion is valid.
</p>
<p>The middle panel contains lists of tools to use in your expression.
Most useful here will be "Field and Values" and "Operators". 
The righthand panel changes appearance depending on what you have selected in the middle panel.
Often it will show help and examples for the chosen function or operator.
It can also display a list of attribute values fould in a field of the attribute table. 
</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>As an example, the following will construct a query to search through the text of each attribute value in a field, looking for a string of characters found anywhere within the text.
Field names require double quote marks; the field name should already be in the lefthand panel.
<code>"FieldName"</code>
The operator to use when searching will, in part, determine what the search phrase looks like.
In the list of operators there are are two similar operators: LIKE and ILIKE.
</p><br>
<p>
LIKE searches for a string within the text of the attribute field.
So <code>"FieldName LIKE 'string'</code> will search for an exact match with string. 
Note that a search term or attribute name must use single quotes.
<code>'string'</code>. 
This will look for the exact word "string" and wil not return any variant on this.
The ILIKE operator is case insensitive and so would return "string", "String", "STRING" and other variations of this.
</p><br>
<p>To search for the string anywhere within text, not only as a standalone word you can use jokers.
The underscore _ takes one unspecified character and the percentage % takes any number.
Therefore to search for string in "This is ALONGStRiNgin som text" the following would work:
<code>"FieldName" ILIKE '%string%'</code>
</p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Using regex.
Regular Expressions are powerful and painful.
You can test out regex expressions <a href="https://regex101.com/">here.</a>
In Expression builder the regex operator is the tilde ~ character.
Look at the following list.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Aword</li>
    <li>AWORD</li>
    <li>aword</li>
    <li>aWord</li>
    <li>name 12</li>
    <li>name 12:1</li>
    <li>other 12</li>
    <li>other 12:1</li>
</ul>

<p>Regex is case sensitive, which means that "aWord" is not the same as "aword" or any of the other variants listed.
To search for aWord simply write
<code>"FieldName" ~ 'aWord'</code>
<br>
But to search case insensitive use instead
<code>"FieldName" ~ '(?i)aword'</code> 
and this would return all four "aword" variants in the list above.
</p>
<p>
To specify some letters and some numbers plus a colon in a particular order:
<code>"FieldName" ~ '[a-zA-Z]+ \d+:'</code> 
This would return true for "name 12:1" and "other 12:1". In this regex search only the colon is given explicitly.</p>
<p>
The part "[a-zA-Z]+ " means search for a string of letters, both lowercase or uppercase, followed by a space.
The part "\d+" means search for a string of numbers.
This is followed directly by the colon.
</p>
